# ABC-Analysis-using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning

ABC analysis is an inventory management technique that determines the value of inventory items based on their importance to the business. ABC ranks items on demand, cost and risk data, and inventory mangers group items into classes based on those criteria. This helps business leaders understand which products or services are most critical to the financial success of their organization.

The most important stock keeping units (SKUs), based on either sales volume or profitability, are “Class A” items, the next-most important are Class B and the least important are Class C. Some companies may choose a classification system that breaks products into more than just those three groups (A-F, for example).

In this Project I have done ABC Anlysis of Sales Data for better decision making.
